Built in Visual Studio 2012 w/ ASP.net.
VS should run IIS. I included the entire project.

C# files can be found in /cs/
CSS files are in /css/
JavaScript files are in /js/

The "Client" according to the supplied class diagram would be calculator.aspx.cs.

calculator.aspx is the main page when the program is ran.

The variable textboxes aren't perfect. They don't disappear if a variable letter is 
changed or removed. The clear button fixes it for now.
